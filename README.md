react-native-ble-plx Developers who love ReactiveX programming may refer to this Low level BLE communication module via service and characteristic UUIDs (i.e BLE commands as hex values ) It's a very stable library, actively maintained, asynchronous in nature but requires lots of memory and comparatively slow performance due to multiple dependent libraries and usage of base64 encoding/decoding for data conversion.
